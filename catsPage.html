	I love cats! I have eight. Yes, eight. And I love dogs, too. But I don't have any. Yet. This gallery has all eight of my cats in it, a few friends cats and a few friends dogs.

			<p class="blurb">The exceedingly handsome tuxedo on the left is Flip. My friend rescued him from a stray cat colony in the courtyard of her building but could not keep him. He was about 6-7 months old. He is a gentle giant and loves being petted, but he likes to make the first move. Oliver is the adorable orange boy on the right. He and Flip are best buds. Oliver is very curious and is the friendliest cat in the world! He loves everyone and loves to play. And not only does he purr all the time, but he's the loudest purrer ever! I got him from a cat rescue when he was 6 months old.</p>
