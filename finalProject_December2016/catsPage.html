	I love cats! I have eight. Yes, eight. And I love dogs, too. But I don't have any. Yet. This gallery has all eight of my cats.

		<div class="picHolderBlurb">
			<p class="blurb">The exceedingly handsome tuxedo on the left is Flip. My friend rescued him from a stray cat colony in the courtyard of her building but could not keep him. He was about 6-7 months old. He is a gentle giant and loves being petted, but he likes to make the first move. If I approach him, he runs. Oliver is the adorable orange boy on the right. He and Flip are best buds. Oliver is very curious and is the friendliest cat in the world! He loves everyone and loves to play and sit on laps. And not only does he purr all the time, but he's the loudest purrer ever! I got him from a cat rescue when he was 6 months old.</p>

		<img class="galleryImages" src="images/cats/lilly.JPG"></img>
		<div class="picHolderBlurb">
			<p class="blurb">Lilly!! Completely black, including paw pads, whiskers and nose. Not one white hair anywhere on her. I liked the irony of "Lilly". A friend told me she was feeding a stray hanging around the front of her building. I grabbed the cat carrier and went to said building. It was a drizzly spring day and poor Lilly was crouching under the outcropping of an air conditioner trying to stay dry. She was about 2 when I found her, unspayed and not well-fed, but not under-fed either. My guess: a store cat that wandered away. She loves sleeping on my keyboard and when I throw her off, she swears at me.</p>

		<div class="picHolder small">
		<img class="galleryImages" src="images/cats/ginger3.jpg"></img>
		<div class="picHolderBlurb">
			<p class="blurb">My calico, Ginger. She is named for the ginger coloring in her fur. Seems that calicos are drama queens. I thought the wild loud caterwauling and frantic screams when I tried to comb her were because she was nearly beaten to death "for fun" by some construction guys that found her and the rest of the litter living in an abandoned building in Brooklyn. I'm sure that's part of it, but I think she might have been that way anyway. She has a little trouble trusting people, even after all these years - she is 16 - but when she feels comfortable with someone, she loves to snuggle.</p>

		<div class="picHolder small">
		<img class="galleryImages" src="images/cats/tina.JPG"></img>
		<div class="picHolderBlurb">
			<p class="blurb">This little beauty is Tina. She is very shy and doesn't like sudden moves or unexpected pets. She came from a cat rescue and I don't know her history, maybe she was abused, maybe she's just really shy. But she's very sweet and when she does let me pet her, she purrs happily! She has an alergy to grains and was sick a lot after I fed her. I didn't know cats could be alergic to grains. So because of Tina, I spend a lot on the finest cat food there is. But she no longer gets sick and has gained some weight as a result. She's also a little friendlier. Some of her "shyness" may have been caused by feeling sick all the time.</p>

		<div class="picHolder small">
		<img class="galleryImages" src="images/cats/irisWindow.JPG"></img>
		<div class="picHolderBlurb">
			<p class="blurb">Iris was living in the ally of a friends apartment. The residents of the building fed her and got her a shelter, but winter was coming and those shelters aren't good enough. So on Halloween night about 6 years ago, I went to my friends with the cat carrier and took her home. I soon found out though, that Iris would really rather have stayed outside. She spent a lot of time sitting on the window sill just looking out. Once or twice I saw her scratch the window pane as if she were pathetically begging the window to open and let her out. It took a while, but she did finally adjust to being an indoor cat.</p>

			<div class="picHolder small">
		<img class="galleryImages" src="images/cats/kaya copy.JPG"></img>
		<div class="picHolderBlurb">
			<p class="blurb">Kaya loves to sleep! And eat! She finds the most cushy, soft places to curl up or stretch out and goes into a deep sleep. She even snores, which is pretty funny to hear. But, if she hears a food sound, she's awake in a flash. She was a one-eyed stray found by a friend of a friend. She was 4 weeks old when I got her and she fit in my hand. Now she is nearly seventeen years old. And she's very attached to her mama, which makes me feel good because the rest of the cats hate me. </p>

		<div class="picHolder small">
		<img class="galleryImages" src="images/cats/emmaline.JPG"></img>
		<div class="picHolderBlurb">
			<p class="blurb">Pregnant, muddy, wet and limping, Emmaline was found in October of this year while I was coming home from a friends apartment. She was crouching in the tree pit outside my building. She looked like she was trying to give birth but seemed like she was having trouble, so we went to the ASPCA and they took the kittens out. Unfortunately, none of them survived. Emmaline had problems delivering because she has hip fractures - thus the limp. Once she was no longer pregnant, I could see she was very skinny. Not anymore! New nickname: Butterball! She has recovered very well and is getting fat and happy!!</p>

		<div class="picHolder small">
		<img class="galleryImages" src="images/cats/iris.JPG"></img>
		<div class="picHolderBlurb">
			<p class="blurb">Iris being shy. When she doesn't want to be petted or spoken to, she will become very aloof. In this photo, she is hiding behind the couch, but she heard food noises and poked her head out to see if it was feeding time.</p>
