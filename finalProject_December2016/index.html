	<p>I am a designer and production artist with 25 years experience working with various clients in all facets of design.
		I live and work in New York City, the best place in the world. The problem with my chosen field, which is advertising, is that when the company you're working for loses a big client, or a couple of clients, there goes a lot of cash flow. And your job. No cash flow, no job. So, I find myself unemployed (again) and hoping for a more secure future if I can incorporate digital work with what I already know of print. <br><br> When I'm not working, my favorite thing to do is walk around the city with my camera. There are so many good photo ops here and the most photogenic to me are old store fronts and signs. Not sure what it is I love so much about those two things. The nostalgia? Partly. The old style of design? Definitly. Curiosity? Most assuredly. But I think the greatest thing about old signs are the skill and craftsmanship that the professional sign painters used in the making of them. Not only the store front signs, but the hand painted signs on the sides of buildings. But those are getting very hard to find. And the ones you can still see are faded and difficult to capture in a photograph.</p>

	<p> I am also an animal lover. Especially cats! I have lived with and loved cats all my life. Right now I have eight. I never meant to have that many but like most animal lovers I'm a sucker for a stray. Three years ago, I moved from my apartment in Hell's Kitchen to West Harlem. There are so many strays up here and in just the last three years, I have taken in 4. That has brought me up to eight. In my old neighborhood, there were no strays, but the pet store around the corner from me had a cat rescue in the back of it. So, me being the way I am, I'd go to the pet store for food and come home with one of the rescues. So altogether there's Ginger, Kaya, Oliver, Flip, Tina, Lilly, Iris and Emmaline. Yep. Two boys and 6 girls. This only includes the ones I have now. Over the years, there have been more than twenty. Not at one time, of course. Eight is the most I've ever had at once. I never thought I'd end up like this. I never said when I was a kid that I wanted to grow up to be a "Crazy Cat Lady". </P>
